# My Fourth Project: Slurps
This project is about providing users with an ecommerce service which enables them to make purchases of juices and milkshakes from the Slurps company. The aim of the website is to inform users on the available drinks offered by Slurps for them to buy. Users are free to browse through the options and select drinks they wish to purchase; regardless of whether they have created an account with Slurps and are currently logged in. If the user wishes to proceed with purchasing their selected items, they are to sign up and be logged into their account before doing so. Once the user is logged in, they will be free to make purchases via card payments. Afterwards, users will receive a receipt and have their orders saved in their profile as part of their order history. Users are free to make further purchases if they choose to do so. As well as edit personal details that will be saved in their profile in addition, resulting from the payment process.
# UX
This website is for any user interested in and looking for an online ecommerce shop where they can buy juice and milkshake drinks via card purchases. 
The Slurps company wants to achieve attracting as many users as possible to engage with their business by browsing their website. They also want as many of these users to create accounts with them and become consistent and regular customers to generate continuous profits for the company. 
The website produced in this project provides Slurps with great ways of them achieving their goals.:
* Firstly, the goal of attracting users to approach their website and stay to browse around will be achieved by the phenomenal UX and UI design created. The website is easy to understand and use upon approaching its landing page. That is, its landing homepage is simple, clear, clean and displays images of all offered drinks along with their prices. Thus being indicative to the user that they have landed on a drink shop website where they can simply scroll through to see the company’s options. All buttons used are labeled legibly and the icons used assists as obvious indicators on what they represent. 
* Secondly, the goal of getting users to create accounts and make purchases will be easily attained because this project allows any user to make selections on the drink items they want and place them in their shopping cart. Users at this point do not need to have an account with Slurps. This prevents disruption from users new to the website. By allowing these users to add items to their cart without accounts, they are also not put off by having to fill in a form beforehand. Thus, making it more likely for users to want to shop with Slurps and be more willing to create accounts later to pay for these items at the end of their shop.
* Lastly, by ensuring the previous two approaches in achieving the previously mentioned goals come to fruition, this website is likely to generate good experiences from the user being able to easily browse and make payments. This is what will make them want to return in the future in order to make new purchases thus, producing repeat business for Slurps.
