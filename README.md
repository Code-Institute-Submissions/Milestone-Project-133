# My Fourth Project: Slurps
This project is about providing users with an ecommerce service which enables them to make purchases of juices and milkshakes from the Slurps company. The aim of the website is to inform users on the available drinks offered by Slurps for them to buy. Users are free to browse through the options and select drinks they wish to purchase; regardless of whether they have created an account with Slurps and are currently logged in. If the user wishes to proceed with purchasing their selected items, they are to sign up and be logged into their account before doing so. Once the user is logged in, they will be free to make purchases via card payments. Afterwards, users will receive a receipt and have their orders saved in their profile as part of their order history. Users are free to make further purchases if they choose to do so. As well as edit personal details that will be saved in their profile in addition, resulting from the payment process.
# UX
This website is for any user interested in and looking for an online ecommerce shop where they can buy juice and milkshake drinks via card purchases. 
The Slurps company wants to achieve attracting as many users as possible to engage with their business by browsing their website. They also want as many of these users to create accounts with them and become consistent and regular customers to generate continuous profits for the company. 
The website produced in this project provides Slurps with great ways of them achieving their goals.:
- Firstly, the goal of attracting users to approach their website and stay to browse around will be achieved by the phenomenal UX and UI design created. The website is easy to understand and use upon approaching its landing page. That is, its landing homepage is simple, clear, clean and displays images of all offered drinks along with their prices. Thus being indicative to the user that they have landed on a drink shop website where they can simply scroll through to see the company’s options. All buttons used are labeled legibly and the icons used assists as obvious indicators on what they represent. 
- Secondly, the goal of getting users to create accounts and make purchases will be easily attained because this project allows any user to make selections on the drink items they want and place them in their shopping cart. Users at this point do not need to have an account with Slurps. This prevents disruption from users new to the website. By allowing these users to add items to their cart without accounts, they are also not put off by having to fill in a form beforehand. Thus, making it more likely for users to want to shop with Slurps and be more willing to create accounts later to pay for these items at the end of their shop.
- Lastly, by ensuring the previous two approaches in achieving the previously mentioned goals come to fruition, this website is likely to generate good experiences from the user being able to easily browse and make payments. This is what will make them want to return in the future in order to make new purchases thus, producing repeat business for Slurps.

## Wireframe & Final Project Differences
### Shopping Cart Button
For desktop screen sizes, the word “__*CART*__” was omitted from being placed next to the shopping cart icon as it was deemed unnecessary. Users can tell, based on the universal shopping cart icon symbol, that clicking with it will lead them to their shopping cart. 
### Signup Login Navigation Link
The “__*Signup/Login*__” link in the navigation bar was split in two. One was made the “__*Sign Up*__” link, the other was made the “__*Log In*__” link. This was done to avoid confusion with the users so they knew the exact page they would be directed to when clicking on the links.
### Signup & Login Page
The signup and login features were produced on separate pages instead of being placed on the same page. This was because on smaller screen sizes, the two separate entities had to be placed on top of each other due to their size taking up the full width of the screen. This was problematic because the login feature, placed underneath the signup feature, could not be seen at first glance once the user had landed on the page. If the user already had an account and was looking to login, there would be initial confusion as the user would not be able to see where they were required to login, despite clicking on the login link. The same problem would present itself if the signup feature was placed at the bottom. If the user was looking to create an account in order to make a purchase, they too would be confused. As a result, this portion of the project was split into two pages.
### Drink Add Buttons
The “__*ADD TO CART*__” buttons on the homepage were changed to “__*ADD*__”. This was done to remove unnecessary text from the screen. Using “__*ADD*__” as the label on the buttons made the page look cleaner with a more simplistic look for the users. Changing the button labels also made the buttons smaller and thus more responsive across different screen sizes.
### Drink Descriptions
their right-hand side. Doing this allowed for more drink images to be displayed on a single row, when showcased on larger screen sizes. This enabled users to see more options sooner. Users being able to see more images of these drinks as soon as they land on the website, increases their likelihood to make purchases.   
### About Us Navigation Link
The “__*About Us*__” navigation link was changed to “__*Our Mission*__” because the about us section sounded more like a series of mission statements practiced by Slurps. It therefore, seemed more appropriate to use a navigation link name that was more reflective of the contents in this portion of the project.
### About Us Title
The “__*About Us*__” title was changed to “__*Mission Statement*__” as its first paragraph focussed on the mission of Slurps, instead of the history of the company. The title therefore became a more accurate reflection on what this part of the project was informing the users on.
### About Us Customer Satisfaction Title
The “__*Customer Satisfaction*__” title was changed to “__*Our Customers*__” to better match the style of the other two mission statements written alongside it. The tile was reduced in length making the page look cleaner, simpler and more responsive across different screen sizes.
### Checkout History Button
The “__*CHECKOUT HISTORY*__” button was changed into a person icon because it was better visually for the user to see a picture representing a function instead of more text. It made it easier and faster for the user to understand how to navigate through the website. Also, the link takes the user to a part of the website where a variety of activities could be carried out instead of only viewing their checkout history. These other activities included: adding emails, saving and updating user personal details and changing their passwords, as well as viewing their order history. So a more generic symbol better suited this.
### Checkout History Title
The “__*Checkout History*__” title was changed into “__*My Profile*__” as its page ended up consisting of more information about the user, other than just their order history. This page contained: the user’s personal details, ability to change personal details, an access link to change their password and the user’s drink order history. Due to all these different features added to this page, its title required a name more reflective of its content thus, “__*My Profile*__”. 
### Checkout History Confirmation Order
The confirmation order of the user’s purchases were made to be redirected to a separate page on its own. This resulted in a more organised structure and flow in using the website.  In addition, the confirmation orders were also made to be sent to the profile page alongside where the user’s personal details and link to change their password were placed.
### Buy Again Buttons
The “__*BUY AGAIN*__” buttons were removed from the project as the tables above them were moved to the “__*My Profile*__” page. The buttons were not moved to the “__*My Profile*__” page alongside the tables because the “__*My Profile*__” page was focused on showing the user’s information regarding their account. Having these buttons present would distract away from this purpose. Also, users could always easily head back to the homepage via the navigation bar’s logo link at the top, to make new purchases.  
### Checkout Title
The “__*Checkout*__” title was changed to “__*Shopping Cart*__” to be more reflective and accurate about the stage at which the user was in. The aim of this portion of the website was to display to users what they had chosen to put in their shopping cart icon and how much the grand total was going to be; before officially making the payment. Using “__*Checkout*__” as a title was too generic for labelling this aim as other events occur at a checkout stage e.g. making payments. As no payments were to be made at this point, the title was changed to be more specific over what the user was doing at this stage of their order.
### Checkout Tables
Tables used in the “__*Checkout*__” page were omitted from this project. Instead the shopping information, regarding the selected drink items, were written freely besides the drink image. This added to the clean and simple overall look of the page.
### Shipping Address Form Input
Shipping Address Form Input
The “__*Shipping Address*__” form input was split into two inputs:  “__*Street Address 1**__” and  “__*Street Address 2*__”. This was done to ensure more specific information came from the user so the drinks could be delivered to the correct address. It was also done to accommodate longer street address names being split up for easier data handling.

# Testing
## Navigation Bars
- Mobile & Tablet 
    - Navigation Bar:
        - Run the HTML and CSS code used to make this navigation bar, in the W3C Markup Validation Service and CSS Validation Service respectively and ensure no errors display.
        - Using chrome development tools, open the Slurps homepage website using: 320x571, 576x571 and 768x571 screen sizes.
        - Ensure the navigation bar colour is “__*#f8f9fa*__” and that it fits the full width of all three of these screen sizes and that the company logo and toggle button on opposite sides fit well and clearly on the navigation bar.
        - Click on the “__*Slurps*__” logo and ensure this redirects the users to the home page of the Slurps website.
        - Hover over and click on the “__*Slurps*__” logo to ensure its text colour changes to “__*#17a2b8*__”.
        - Click on the toggle button and ensure its outline changes to the “__*#17a2b8*__” colour to indicate that the button has been clicked. 
        - Ensure that on all three of the 320x571, 576x571 and 768x571 screen sizes, the navigation bar’s dropdown background actually drops down and fills the length of the screen. 
        - Ensure the website's links inside the dropdown navigation bar stay within its width; not overlapping outside it.
        - Hover over and click on each link in this navigation bar and ensure the background colour for the links hovered over and clicked on changes to “__*#17a2b8*__”.
        - Click on the “__*Juices*__” and “__*Milkshakes*__” links and check they scroll down to the “__*Juices*__” and “__*Milkshakes*__” sections of the home page respectively.
        - Click on the “__*Our Mission*__”,“__*Sign Up*__” and “__*Log In*__” links and check they redirect the users to the “__*Our Mission*__”,“__*Sign Up*__” and “__*Log In*__” pages of the website respectively.
        - Conduct the following to test the search bar:
            - Enter the cursor in the search bar at the top of the website and type in “__*berry*__”. Then, press the button with the magnifying glass icon on it to enter the search “__*berry*__” into the website.
            - Ensure the background colour of the button with the magnifying glass icon is light blue and when it’s clicked on, ensure the outline colour changes to “__*#17a2b8*__” for both the search bar input field and its button.
            - Once the search is done, ensure the “__*berry*__” word entered remains in the search bar even after the search has gone through and ensure the message “__*Search results for: "berry"*__” appears at the top of the screen.
            - As this website does have drink names with the word “__*berry*__” in them, ensure there are drink options that do appear underneath the  “__*Search results for: "berry"*__” message.
            - Go through the appeared search options and check that all the drink names contain the word “__*berry*__” in them. Then go through the remaining drinks on the homepage that were not featured as part of the search results and ensure they do not have the “__*berry*__” word in them.
            - As this website has no drink names with the word “__*fish*__” in them, enter “__*fish*__” in the search bar and ensure there are no drink options that appear underneath the “__*Search results for: "fish"*__” message. Instead make sure the message “__*No results found for: "fish"*__” is shown.
            - Also check that searching based on the drink names is the only way for users to get drink results provided from the search bar. Do this by entering in the search bar “__*1x800ml*__”, a non drink name but present across the homepage as part of some of the drink’s descriptions, and make sure no drink options display and the message “__*No results found for: "1x800ml"*__” appears.
    - User Profiles and Shopping Cart Banner:
        - Run the HTML and CSS code used to make this banner, in the W3C Markup Validation Service and CSS Validation Service respectively and ensure no errors display.
        - Using chrome development tools, open the Slurps home page using: 320x571, 576x571 and 768x571 screen sizes.
        - Ensure its background colour is light blue and the width of this banner fills the width of the screen for each of these screen sizes.
        - Check that the person icon is clearly positioned in the banner, across these different screen sizes, and when clicked changes to the “__*#17a2b8*__” 
            colour. Also when clicked, ensure the website is redirected to the “__*My Profile*__” page, when users are logged in, or the “__*Log In*__” page when users are not logged in.
        - Check the shopping cart icon, drink counter and the price total can all be seen clearly and don’t overlap each other across each of these screen sizes.
        - Click the shopping cart icon and make sure it changes to the “__*#17a2b8*__”
            colour and redirects the website to the “__*Shopping Cart*__” page. 
        - Add an item to the shopping cart, from the home page and check that the same number of items added to the shopping cart is shown in the drink counter. For example, if seven items are added to the shopping cart, ensure the counter displays the number “__*7*__”.  If these items are reduced by two, ensure the drink counter displays “__*5*__”. Also ensure the background colour of the drink counter is “__*#f8f9fa*__”
            and when clicked, its outline colour changes to “__*#17a2b8*__”.
        - Add an item to the shopping cart, from the home page and check that the price of the item is shown as the same price in the price total located in this banner. For instance, add a drink that costs “__*£13.00*__”

        - Add two more of the same drink that cost “__*£13.00*__” 
            and make sure the price total in the banner adds them up correctly, therefore displaying “__*£39.00*__” as a result.
        - Reduce the number of drinks added to the shopping cart by one and ensure the price total subtracts the cost correctly and shows “__*£23.00*__” in its price total.
        - Also ensure the price total changes its text colour to “__*#17a2b8*__” when hovered over or clicked on.
    - Delivery Banner:

        - Ensure the text “__*Deliveries Only*__ __*<del>£35*__ __*£5!*__”
            is legible and clearly organised, separate from the other banner and navigation bar above.
        - Check the “__*£35*__” 
            price is crossed out and the “__*£5*__” price is highlighted with a light blue background colour and a box shadow so it stands out the most, out of all the text on the banner.

    - Across these different screen sizes check the drink images and their descriptions don’t overlap the content of the other drink items displayed besides them.
    - Ensure any drink produced from the search results, that also exists within the “__*New Drinks*__” section, appears with a “__*NEW!*__” sticker on them. 
    - Test the “__*no-image.PNG*__” is seen when no drink image is available by negating the condition of the “__*for/endfor*__” statements wrapped around the code for the images. Upon doing so, ensure the crossed out camera image is seen clearly, in place of the drink image.
    - Hover over the shortened drink names that have ellipsis written at the end of them and ensure the full name of the drink can be seen as a tooltip when doing so. Also check the rest of the drink descriptions are clearly displayed, easy to read and understand. 
    - Make sure that in all the drink quantity forms, underneath these drinks, the forms are prefilled with a default value of “__*1*__” written in each of these forms with an “__*ADD*__” button next to them.

        - Once on the page, check that the added drinks in the “__*Shopping Cart*__” page are the same drinks that were added from the home page and ensure that in their edit form input fields, the number “__*4*__” is present for each of them.
        - Repeat this same test for other drinks using different quantity numbers and always go to the “__*Shopping Cart*__” page to ensure the same drink item(s) and their quantity number, taken from the home page’s quantity form, appears in the “__*Shopping Cart*__” page.

## Jasmine Testing
- Jasmine testing was used to test the Javascript involved in this project. This testing was specifically used to ensure the numerical and string values in the Javascript portion of the project were functioning correctly and not producing any errors. It was also used to ensure the card payment input worked well and the correct css properties for the stripe element were being produced, in order to match the properties used in the rest of the payment form. This included ensuring the correct: font colour, text transformation, font family, font size, etc were used for the stripe element.
- These testing files are ran by opening up the “__*slurps.js*__” and “__*slurpsSpec.js*__” files and writing up tests in them. Next, in the “__*jasmineTesting.html*__” file, the Jasmine framework links as well as the script links to the  “__*slurps.js*__” and “__*slurpsSpec.js*__” files are to be written inside the “__*jasmineTesting.html*__” file. Then, the preview button from the “__*jasmineTesting.html*__” file is to be clicked on, to open it up and see which tests failed and which passed. 
- Directories of Jasmine test files:
    - [**_slurps.js_**](jasmineTesting/scripts/slurps.js)
    - [**_slurpsSpec.js_**](jasmineTesting/spec/slurpsSpec.js)
    - [**_jasmineTesting.html_**](jasmineTesting/jasmineTesting.html)
## Python Unit testing
- Python unit testing was carried out to test the python files of the project. Python files such as: “__*forms.py*__”, “__*models.py*__”, “__*views.py*__”, etc for each app, were created and tests were written in them to ensure the website's functionality worked. In addition, the data types present in the python files were tested to make sure they were the correct data type and didn’t produce errors when the website was in operation. The written tests in these python test files also ensured that the web pages of the website could render out their respective templates and produce a “__*200 HTTP status code*__” in the Gitpod terminal.
- These testing files are ran by firstly creating “__*tests.py*__” files for each project’s app and then specifying the exact python file of the app the“__*tests.py*__” file will be testing. E.g.: “__*tests_apps.py*__” when testing the “__*apps.py*__” file, “__*tests_models.py*__” when testing the “__*models.py*__” file,  “__*tests_forms.py*__” when testing the “__*forms.py*__” file, and so on. Next, tests are written in these python test files; for testing the website. Then, “__*python3 manage.py test*__” is entered in the Gitpod terminal and the results of the tests are printed in the terminal soon after. The terminal at this point is checked to see how many tests were conducted and that there is a line of dots present. This syntax of a line of dots means that all the tests have passed.

### Heroku Website
1. Create an account with the Heroku website then click on the “__*Deploy*__” tab and select “__*GitHub*__”, under the “__*Deployment method*__” heading, to connect github with Heroku.
2. Search for the repository name of the current project in the search bar under the “__*Connect to GitHub*__” heading and then click on “__*connect*__” once found.
3. Click on __*Enable Automatic Deploys*__” under the “__*Automatic deploys*__” heading, to automatically deploy the project’s code to Heroku whenever the project is pushed to the master branch on its GitHub repository.
4. Click on the “__*Resources*__” tab in the Heroku website and enter “__*postgres*__” in its search bar and select “__*Heroku Postgres*__”.
5. Leave the “__*Heroku Postgres*__” on the “__*Hobby Dev - Free*__” setting and then click “__*Provision*__”.
6. Click on the “__*Settings*__” tab in the Heroku website then click on “__*Reveal Config Vars*__” to confirm that Heroku has provided a “__*DATABASE_URL*__” to be connected to, from inside Django. This means the URL will be made available to the project’s app and can be connected to the Postgres database.
7. Add the following variables to this section of the Heroku website before clicking the “__*Add*__” button:
    - “__*HEROKU_HOSTNAME*__” with the value of the project app’s hostname on Heroku 
    - “__*SECRET_KEY*__” with the value of a confidential key.
    - “__*AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID*__” with its value downloaded from the “__*.csv*__” file
    - “__*AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY*__” with its value downloaded from the “__*.csv*__” file
    - “__*USE_AWS*__” with its value set to “__*True*__”, so the “__*settings.py*__” file knows to use the AWS configuration when deployed to Heroku.
    - “__*STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY*__” with its value from the “__*Stripe*__” website.
    - “__*STRIPE_SECRET_KEY*__” with its value from the “__*Stripe*__” website. 
    - “__*STRIPE_WH_SECRET*__” with its value from the “__*Stripe*__” website.
8. If present, remove the “__*DISABLE COLLECTSTATIC VARIABLE*__” and its value so Django can collect static files automatically and upload them to “__*S3*__”.
### Outside Environment Variables
1. Outside of the project’s workspace and in the Gitpod’s settings, set the “__*DEVELOPMENT*__” environment variable to “__*True*__”.
2. Set the “__*SECRET_KEY*__” variable to a confidential key value. 
3. Restart the workspace to set the development server.
### Settings.py File
1. In the “__*settings.py*__” file of the project, create a new variable called “__*DATABASES*__” and set its value as a dictionary with the key value name as “__*default*__”. Set the “__*default*__” value as “__*dj_database_url.parse(“os.environ.get(“DATABASE_URL”)”)*__”.
2. Import “__*dj_database_url*__” at the top of the “__*settings.py*__” file so the key pair value in the “__*DATABASES*__” variable can be used.
3. Create an if condition where if “__*“DATABASE_URL” in os.environ*__”
is the case, the “__*DATABASE = {“default”:dj_database,parse(os.environ.get(“DATABASE”))}*__” condition will be produced. Otherwise, the default configuration of “__*DATABASES = {'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',}}*__” will be used.
4. Set the value of the “__*SECRET_KEY*__” variable in the “__*settings.py*__” file to “__*SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(“SECRET_KEY”, “”)*__”. This will prevent the Django server from starting if its environment variable is not set.
5. Set “__*DEBUG=“DEVELOPMENT” in os.environ*__” and hide the “__*SECRET_KEY*__” to avoid exposing internal source codes on the error page. 
6. Add “__*development = os.environ.get("DEVELOPMENT", False)*__” to the “__*settings.py*__” file to also avoid exposing internal source codes on the error page.
7. Locate the “__*ALLOWED HOSTS*__” variable and in its square brackets enter “__*os.environ.get(“HEROKU_HOSTNAME”)*__”.
8. Set an if condition for the existence of the “__*development*__” variable stating that if in development mode, the project’s code will use the configuration for the squlite database and use “__*ALLOWED HOSTS = [“localhost”]*__”. Otherwise, it is to use the database URL configuration for Heroku and use “__*ALLOWED HOSTS = [“os.environ.get(“HEROKU_HOSTNAME”)”]*__”.
9. Add “__*storages*__” to the “__*INSTALLED APPS*__” list in the settings.py file. 
10. To connect “__*Django*__” to “__*S3*__”, create an if statement where if “__*USE_AWS*__ __*in os.environ:*__”, is fulfilled then the following are produced: 
    - “__*AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {“Expires”: “Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT”, “CacheControl”: “max-age=94608000”,}*__”
    - “__*AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = milestone-project-4-vivian*__”
    - “__*AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = “us-east-1”*__”
    - “__*AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get(“AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID”)*__”
    - “__*AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get(“AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY”)*__”
    - “__*AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f“{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com”*__”
    - “__*STATICFILES_STORAGE = “custom_storages.StaticStorage”*__” 
    - “__*STATICFILES_LOCATION = “static”*__” 
    - “__*DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = “custom_storages.MediaStorage”*__” 
    - “__*MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = “media”*__” 
    - “__*STATIC_URL = f“https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/”*__” 
    - “__*MEDIA_URL = f“https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/”*__” 
### Gitpod Terminal 
1. Create a superuser to login with, using “__*python3 manage.py createsuperuser*__” in the Gitpod terminal.
2. Create a Heroku app and specify its region by entering “__*heroku apps: create milestone-project-4-vivian --region eu*__” in the Gitpod terminal, to set up a git repository.
3. Install “__*psycopg2*__”  by typing “__*pip3 install psycopg2-binary*__” in the terminal in order to use postgres.
4. Install “__*green unicorn*__”  by typing “__*pip3 install gunicorn*__” in the terminal to replace the development server once the website is deployed to Heroku and act as the web server.
5. Enter “__*pip3 install dj-database-url*__” in the terminal to install the “__*dj-database-url*__” package and parse the database url that Heroku creates and gets all the connection information out of it.
6. Get the URL of the remote database by entering “__*heroku config*__” in the terminal. This also enables the ability to get, edit, set, and unset environment variables for the Heroku app.
7. Run the command “__*heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app milestone-project-4-vivian*__” in the Gitpod terminal.
8. In the terminal, run migrations by typing in “__*python3 manage.py migrate*__”.
9. Import the drinks and about us data, using their fixtures, by typing the following in the Gitpod terminal:
    - “__*python3 manage.py load data drinks*__”
    - “__*python3 manage.py load data drink_types*__”
    - “__*python3 manage.py load data about_us*__”
    - “__*python3 manage.py load data about_us_sections*__”
10. In the terminal, install “__*boto3*__” and “__*django_storages*__” by entering “__*pip3 install boto3*__” and “__*pip3 install django_storages*__” respectively.
### Additional Files
1. Create a file called “__*.gitignore*__”
and add “__**.squlite3*__” in it, to ignore all files with a squlite3 extension. Also add “__*__pycache\__/*__”
in the same file, to add all pycache directories which contain compiled Python code.
2. Inform Heroku that this project is to be a web application with a web server and start “__*green unicorn*__” by creating a “__*Procfile*__” file. 
3. In the “__*Procfile*__” file, type in “__*web:gunicorn django_milestone-project-4-vivian.wsgi:application*__” to tell gunicorn to run using the project’s wsgi module to allow it to handle HTTP requests. 
4. Create a new file called “__*custom_storages.py*__”  to tell django “__*S3*__” is to be used in production to store static files and any uploaded images,  whenever collectstatic is run.
### Deploy
1. Enter “__*pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt*__” in the Gitpod terminal to inform Heroku on what it needs to install for the website to work. It will inform Heroku about all the packages it requires to install using pip.
2. Add all the files to the local git repository by entering in the Gitpod terminal “__*git add .*__” then enter “__*git status*__” to see that all the files have been added to the local repository.
3. Commit the changes made to the files in this project by entering in the Gitpod terminal “__*git commit -m “Deploy to heroku”*__”.  
4. Push these committed changes made to the files in this project, to the remote repository, by entering “__*git push origin master*__” in the Gitpod terminal. 
5. Push the code to the Heroku repository, created by the Heroku app, by entering “__*git push heroku master*__” in the Gitpod terminal. This will detect the Python app and install Python as a result, as well as pip, sqlite3 and all the requirements in the “__*requirements.text*__” file. 
6. Back on the Heroku website, click on the “__*Activity*__” tab to see the project’s app being built as well as its log. Ensure “__*Build finished*__” can be seen at the bottom of its build log to confirm that the project was deployed successfully. 
7. Finally, click on the “__*Deploy Branch*__” button, under the “__*Manual deploy*__” heading, within the “__*Deploy*__” tab to deploy the project.
